Create class hierarchy, starting with abstract class Shape:
	Abstract methods:
	calculatePerimeter(): doulbe
	calculateArea(): double
	Virtual methods:
	Draw(): string
Extend Shape class with two children:
	Rectangle
	Circle
Each of them need to have: 
	Fields: 
	height and width for Rectangle
	radius for Circle
	Encapsulation for this fields
	Public constructor 
	Concrete methods for calculations (perimeter and area)
	Override methods for drawing
