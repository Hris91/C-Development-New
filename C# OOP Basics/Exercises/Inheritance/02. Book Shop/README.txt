You are working in a library. And you are pissed of writing descriptions for books by hand, so you wish to use the computer to speed up the process. The task is simple - your program should have two classes – one for the ordinary books – Book, and another for the special ones – GoldenEditionBook. So let’s get started! We need two classes:
•	Book - represents a book that holds title, author and price. A book should offer information about itself in the format shown in the output below.
•	GoldenEditionBook - represents a special book holds the same properties as any Book, but its price is always 30% higher.
Constraints
•	If the author’s second name is starting with a digit– exception’s message is: "Author not valid!"
•	If the title’s length is less than 3 symbols – exception’s message is: "Title not valid!"
•	If the price is zero or it is negative – exception’s message is: "Price not valid!"
•	Price must be formatted to one symbol after the decimal separator
