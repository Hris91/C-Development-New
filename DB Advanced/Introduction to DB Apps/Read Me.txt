Showing us why Entity Framework is way better than this. Also SQL Injections and how to protect our Apps from it.

Write a program that connects to your localhost server. Create new database called MinionsDB where we will keep information about our minions and villains. 
For each minion we should keep information about its name, age and town.  Each town has information about the country where it’s located. Villains have name and evilness factor (super good, good, bad, evil, super evil). Each minion can serve several villains and each villain can have several minions serving him. Fill all tables with at least 5 records each.
In the end you shoud have the following tables: 
•	Countries
•	Towns
•	Minions
•	EvilnessFactors
•	Villains
•	MinionsVillains

Write a program that prints on the console all villains’ names and their number of minions of those who have more than 3 minions ordered descending by number of minions.
